        "description": "Want to know how Spotify, Amazon, and Netflix generate recommendations for their users? This talk walks through the steps involved in building a recommendation pipeline, from data cleaning, hyperparameter tuning, model training and evaluation.\n\nPersonalized recommendation systems play an integral role in e-commerce platforms, with the goal of driving user engagement. While there is extensive literature on the theory behind recommendation systems, there is limited material that describes the underlying infrastructure of a recommendation system pipeline. In this talk, we will walk through the process of designing and building a recommendation system pipeline. We will specifically discuss techniques for data cleaning and normalization, hyperparameter tuning, model training and fitting, as well as quantitative and qualitative model evaluation. By the end of this talk, you will learn how to design your own recommendation system pipeline from scratch.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJill is a data scientist at BioSymetrics, where she applies machine learning techniques to biomedical data. Outside of work, Jill is working on an open-source toolkit for implicit feedback recommendation systems.

This video will help you to understand what is a movie recommendation system, How a movie recommendation system works, the Filtering Strategies of the recommendation system - Filtering based on content, and Collaboration filtering after which will do a hands-on lab demo to build a movie recommendation system using python. \n\n‚úÖ How To Build A Movie Recommendation System\n03:00  What is a movie recommendation system\n03:30 How the movie recommendation system works\n04:24 Filtering strategies of movie recommendation system.\n09:00 Hands-on lab demo\n\n‚û°Ô∏è What is Movie Recommendation System?\nA movie recommendation system, also known as a movie recommender system, uses machine learning (ML) to predict or filter users' film preferences based on their prior decisions and actions. \n\n‚û°Ô∏è How does the movie recommendation system work?\nEvery recommender system primarily consists of two components: users and items. Users receive movie predictions from the system, and the actual movies are the products.\nFiltering and predicting only the movies that a matching user is most likely to wish to see is the main objective of movie recommendation systems. The user information from the system's database is used by the ML algorithms for these recommendation systems. Based on information from the past, this data is used to forecast the user in question's behavior in the future.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Filtering Strategies of recommendation system\n- Filtering based on content\nA method of filtering movies in movie recommendation systems that makes advantage of the items' data (movies). This information, which is taken from just one user, is quite important in this case. This technique uses an ML algorithm to suggest movies that are comparable to the user's past choices. Therefore, the information about the prior movie choices and likes of just one person is used to generate similarity in content-based filtering.\n\n- Collaboration Filtering\nAs the name implies, this filtering technique is based on the interactions between the relevant person and other users. For the best outcomes, the system contrasts and compares these behaviors. It combines the film choices and usage patterns of several people.\n\nLink for the datasets: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10P7C-suaBAA5_ZAi4oEO_Pmsb7kG6JMZ?usp=sharing\n\n‚û°Ô∏èAbout AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp\nThe AI and Machine Learning Bootcamp provides Caltech CTME's academic prowess to help you accelerate your data science career.

This video will help you to understand what is a movie recommendation system, How a movie recommendation system works, the Filtering Strategies of the recommendation system - Filtering based on content, and Collaboration filtering after which will do a hands-on lab demo to build a movie recommendation system using python. \n\n‚úÖ How To Build A Movie Recommendation System\n03:00  What is a movie recommendation system\n03:30 How the movie recommendation system works\n04:24 Filtering strategies of movie recommendation system.\n09:00 Hands-on lab demo\n\n‚û°Ô∏è What is Movie Recommendation System?\nA movie recommendation system, also known as a movie recommender system, uses machine learning (ML) to predict or filter users' film preferences based on their prior decisions and actions. \n\n‚û°Ô∏è How does the movie recommendation system work?\nEvery recommender system primarily consists of two components: users and items. Users receive movie predictions from the system, and the actual movies are the products.\nFiltering and predicting only the movies that a matching user is most likely to wish to see is the main objective of movie recommendation systems. The user information from the system's database is used by the ML algorithms for these recommendation systems. Based on information from the past, this data is used to forecast the user in question's behavior in the future.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Filtering Strategies of recommendation system\n- Filtering based on content\nA method of filtering movies in movie recommendation systems that makes advantage of the items' data (movies). This information, which is taken from just one user, is quite important in this case. This technique uses an ML algorithm to suggest movies that are comparable to the user's past choices. Therefore, the information about the prior movie choices and likes of just one person is used to generate similarity in content-based filtering.\n\n- Collaboration Filtering\nAs the name implies, this filtering technique is based on the interactions between the relevant person and other users. For the best outcomes, the system contrasts and compares these behaviors. It combines the film choices and usage patterns of several people.\n\nLink for the datasets: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10P7C-suaBAA5_ZAi4oEO_Pmsb7kG6JMZ?usp=sharing\n\n‚û°Ô∏èAbout AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp\nThe AI and Machine Learning Bootcamp provides Caltech CTME's academic prowess to help you accelerate your data science career.

The latest natural language processing model is fueled with over trillion parameters while the memory need of neural recommendation and ranking models has grown from hundreds of gigabyte to the terabyte scale. This talk introduces the underinvested deep learning personalization and recommendation systems in the overall research community. The training of state-of-the-art industry-scale personalization and recommendation models consumes the highest number of compute cycles among all deep learning use cases at Facebook. For AI inference, recommendation use cases consume even higher compute cycles of 80%. What are the key system challenges faced by industry-scale neural personalization and recommendation models? This talk will highlight recent advances on AI system development for deep learning recommendation and the implications on infrastructure optimization opportunities across the machine learning system stack. System research for deep learning recommendation and AI at large is at a nascent stage. This talk will conclude with research directions for building and designing responsible AI systems ‚Äì that is fair, efficient, and environmentally sustainable.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nCarole-Jean Wu is a Technical Lead and Manager at Facebook AI Research ‚Äì SysML. Her work is in the domain of computer system architecture with particular emphasis on energy- and memory-efficient systems. Her research has pivoted into designing systems for machine learning execution at-scale, such as for personalized recommender systems and mobile deployment. In general, she is interested in tackling system challenges to enable efficient, responsible AI execution. Carole-Jean chairs the MLPerf Recommendation Benchmark Advisory Board, co-chaired MLPerf Inference, and serves on the MLCommons Board as a director. Carole-Jean received her M.A. and Ph.D. from Princeton and B.Sc. from Cornell.
